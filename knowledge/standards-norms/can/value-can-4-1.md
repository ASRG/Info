# Value CAN 4-1



## Value CAN 4-1 Vehicle Network Interface

1 channel CAN with USB-A cable. Does not include cable for OBD / J1939.

### Low Cost, High Value Vehicle Network Interface for CAN

The ValueCAN 4-1 is the next-generation, low-cost, high-performance tool for CAN 2.0. The ValueCAN 4-1 comes with all the field-tested features of the ValueCAN 3, plus much more, including standalone operating capability using a USB charging source/5V supply. The ValueCAN 4-1 supports 1x CAN channel, has USB Type A and Type C options available, and certified drivers for Windows Vista, 7, 8, 10.

### Superior Engineering

The ValueCAN 4-1 is fully isolated from the PC, and its isolation layer is self-powered from USB, which eliminates the need for external power for the CAN transceiver. The ValueCAN 4-1â€™s isolation, a feature not common on low-cost interfaces, eliminates issues with grounding or noise affecting your PC and its communications. The ValueCAN 4-1 is also electrically hardened to survive in an abusive environment, including reverse battery voltage and electrical transients. To make wiring easy, the device pinout is printed clearly on the housing. The ValueCAN 4-1 is also backed by a one-year warranty.

### Real-Time Acceleration and Standalone Mode for ECU Simulation

The ValueCAN 4-1 can load real-time Function Block scripts Vehicle Spy Professional. These scripts then execute in real time with microsecond resolution. The scripts can be controlled and monitored with a PC application or operate in standalone mode.

### Chipset?

* MCP MCP2562FD PHY

### High-Level Protocols Supported

The ValueCAN 4-1 is compatible with J1939, OBD2 on CAN, Keyword Protocol over CAN, UDS diagnostics, CCP/XCP, DeviceNet, and CANOpen. We offer cables for J1939 and automotive diagnostics on CAN.

### Software Support: Turn-Key
