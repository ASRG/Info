# Monthly Meetings

To support the goal to increasing competencies within the automotive industry, ASRG has monthly meetings to discuss publicly open and released information regarding the industry.  We also invite guest speakers to present a topic related to automotive security. 

Monthly meetings are designed to be an open conversation... a meeting... a discussion.  The idea is to ask questions, give feedback, and comment during the presentations.  However, depending on how many people are attending, the presenters might ask to hold questions and comments until the end of the presentation, otherwise a presentation with 100 participants could require hours when only 15 mins were planned.  

### Typical Agenda
