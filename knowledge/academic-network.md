# Academic Network

## What is the Academic Network?

ASRG Academic Network connects the researchers, students, professors and professionals in the field of automotive cybersecurity to each other on the global stage.   
****

The ASRG is building the Academic Network to bridge industry and academia. We're working on building a template to create "Academic Societies" at Universities around the world to bring resources to student groups and facilitate their research. Further, we pair Academic Societies with a local chapter to support collaboration between professionals, hackers, and academics. To best equip academic societies, we're building a learning platform so that students can gain access to educational resources in the space. The Academic Network also includes "Technical Committees", or groups of experts from industry and academia that provide solutions to challenges in the space.  
****

### **Mission**

Enable the academic community to connect, collaborate and share knowledge 

### **Vision**

A thriving global community of academic institutions that can collaborate to solve the hardest challenges in automotive security that face industry.

## **Challenges**

1. **Missing University Curriculums**

Many technically focused universities have yet to react to the market need of dedicated programs aimed at transportation related security.  
****

1. **Inadequate Relationship to Industry** 

To ensure the availability of talent to support industry needs, a strong relationship between industry and academia is required to inspire, educate, and enable the next technological advancements and talent.  
****

1. **Non-Applied Research**

As researchers fail to understand the real industry issues and challenges, innovation fails to make progress in many areas of development.  
****

1. **No Certification Program**

The talent pool needs a structured competency management program to allow the future work-force a feeling of accomplishment and employers to ensure talent pool credentials.

1. **High Barrier of Entry**

New or exist talent entering the automotive security space find it difficult to obtain needed resources, positive culture, and support to be successful and provide secure solutions in the industry.  


## **The Solution**

#### **Academic Societies:**

To bring the academic community together from different academic institutions and research centres. Bringing academic research and innovation closer to industry 

#### **Technical Committees**

For the tracking the development of the technology and driving the research and innovation in specific areas  


**Learning Platform**

A self-learning platform for the competency development and knowledge sharing. Bridging the talent and skills gap.
