# Security Library

What is in the library?  Basically, anything and everything that is relevant to Automotive Security topics.  This includes eBooks, presentations, videos, links and much more.  You should also contribute to the library, add your own resources \(that are available to the public, no proprietary information\), add folders, make it your own... we just ask that you don't delete data and respect the structure of the folders.  

### How to get access?

Click the below link and request access.  The access request will be send to the system admins and they should be able to grant you access within 24 hours \(normally faster\).
