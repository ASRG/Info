# Public Google Drive

The [Public Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BzyWkL7LbFrUV2M5RjRIVEVhQXM) is the storage where access is granted for the ASRG members. Here we have the valuable documents for our members and that is why it should be kept up to date.

### Monthly Meeting presentations

One of the valuable material for the ASRG members are the presentations from our MonthlyMeetings. To have it accessible for them the lead coordinators from every location should store it in Adobe PDF format there after the MonthlyMeeting took place. The location for the presentations are present in folder `../01. Events/01. MonthlyMeetings`. Inside this folder is one folder for every location and inside are subfolders for every MonthlyMeeting. Naming convention for the MonthlyMeeting folder is _`Meetingnumber. title_yearmonthday`_- as example: `26. Automotive_Security_Operations_Center_20191015`.
