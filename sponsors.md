# Sponsors

We need sponsors to enable us and our members to get more value out of ASRG.  This could include money, resources, locations, events, presentations and so on.  Anything that builds value for the members or has the potential to build value in the future. &#x20;

### Strategy

We don't want to go and just ask for money.  The point is to build relationships with the companies and allow them to see for themselves the value of an organized security community who is focused on advancing the topic, creating awareness and educating the talent pool.&#x20;

### Initial Contact

### Customer Relationship Management (CRM)

In our case the CRM is more like Sponsorship Relationship Management (SRM), however the term CRM is more prevalent in the industry.  It's very important to management the different contacts that we have with our sponsors.  Since we are a very international organization, it could be that we have relationships with the same company in more than one location and the communication with these companies needs to be managed.  In general, we must manage the status and relationships that we have with all sponsors and make sure that all commitments are fulfilled.&#x20;

We will be using Salesforce as our CRM.  Salesforce has a nice package for non-profit companies. &#x20;
