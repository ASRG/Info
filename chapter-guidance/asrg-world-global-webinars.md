# ASRG-WORLD Global Webinars

Running a successful global webinar takes really tight coordination and attention to detail. There's a LOT that can go wrong, very fast. Each webinar helps the ASRG build momentum, so it's really important that they go smoothly and communicate the competence that we have as an organization. We're fortunate to have a really great, smart team across the globe to help organize these webinars. This article will highlight some key challenges and tips to address them.&#x20;

## Planning an ASRG-WORLD Webinar

Webinar should be entered into the Roadmap.  It will be then set with a "In Plan" status and the date will be reserved for that webinar. Link to Roadmap is below.&#x20;

At this point in time, the date is reserved for that webinar and named the moderator, you can continue to plan and prepare the webinar together with the presenter.&#x20;

Please make sure to update the status of the webinar.&#x20;

#### Webinar Statuses

In Plan:  The timeslot is reserved for that webinar.  At this point, all the details of the webinar do not need to be known. &#x20;

## Preparing a Webinar

### What is needed from the presenter?

* Title of presentation
* Abstract of the presentation
* Short Bio
* GDPR Letter ([https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wMEex6i4VJnI7PVxK8FjuSOgxBsJPZGFRkj6tiJd0eQ/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wMEex6i4VJnI7PVxK8FjuSOgxBsJPZGFRkj6tiJd0eQ/edit))

### Preparation Meeting

Please setup a preparation meeting with the host and the presenter a few days before the planned webinar.  This will allow the presenter and host to meet each other, discuss how the webinar will work, and check all the technical aspects of hosting a webinar.&#x20;

#### Proposed Agenda

1. Introductions: Know each other Identify Roles (Moderator / Support / Presenters / etc.)&#x20;
2. Technical Setup Checks (Audio / Video)&#x20;
3. Quick presentation reviews (Define the final webinar sequence)&#x20;
4. How to work with Q\&A (Youtube Chat Window)&#x20;
5. Clarification of final questions

#### Hints for Presenters

* Make sure the computer that he/she will be presenting from,  has been restarted that day.
* Make sure that internet connect is **not** over wifi.  A direct LAN connection is necessary. The reason for this is that wifi is not stable enough.  There are so many influences to a wifi signal strength and stability, and we don't want the risk for ASRG webinars.&#x20;
* Do **not **use the microphone from the computer... Please use a headset or external microphone. &#x20;
* If they are using a bluetooth, or wireless headset, please make sure that the batteries are changed.
* All messaging programs on all computers / mobiles / cellphones shall be **turned off or silenced**.  Even the devices which are not involved in the webinar, as it will cause background noise.
* Make sure that the environment where the presenter will be presenting is **quiet and controlled**.  Babies, dogs, and open windows can create unwanted noise.
* Watching the YouTube Channel at the same time as presenting, can be confusing.  There is a **20-30 second delay** between Google Meets and YouTube.  This means that watching the questions in the Youtube Chat window and trying to answer in the Google Meets will be quite confusing. &#x20;

## Key Challenges with Webinars

Webinars rely on a tremendous amount of technology. Namely:

* Fast internet connectivity. (do not use wifi connections, direct connections only)
* Effective streaming platforms (I.e. YouTube Live)&#x20;
* Effective streaming software (I.e. OBS)
* Ability to tightly control audio in/out.&#x20;
* Ability to tightly control screen sharing.&#x20;
* Handling questions from audience and passing them to presenter, even with a delay.&#x20;

## Process of Organizing an ASRG-WORLD Webinar

1. Identify your speaker, title and proposed date
2. Enter information and approved date in ASRG Roadmap
3. Contact Speaker to confirm date and request official title, abstract, short bio, personal picture to be shared on marketing material and signed GDPR form
4. Add to YouTube
   1. A YouTube link needs to be created.
   2. Go to the ASRG YouTube Page.
   3. Make sure that you are logged in to your ASRG account.
   4. Go to the YouTube Studio Page.
   5. In the top right corner, click the button "**CREATE"**.&#x20;
   6. Select "**Go-Live**"
   7. Select "**Schedule Stream**"
   8. Enter all the information.&#x20;
      1. At the question "Is this video made for kids", select **"No, it's not made for kids"**
   9. And then click "**Create Stream**"
   10. Now you have created the scheduled stream.
   11. Please use the Share link in the top right of the page to create the YouTube Link.&#x20;
5. Create marketing materials:
   * Text for Meetup&#x20;
   * Marketing Image
   * LinkedIn / Twitter (Social Media Announcement)
6. Add marketing materials to https://asrg.io/world/webinars.html. (ask John)
7. Add an Event on LinkedIn
8. Add an Event on Facebook
9. Add the Social Media marketing plan in Hootsuite.
10. Distribute (email on ASRG-LEADERS, leaders@asrg.io) marketing materials to Meetup groups, globally. An event has to be created in EACH CHAPTER with the proper TIME ZONES (this is more challenging than you'd think). This should point people to the ASRG website. (Phew, event's posted. Now we have to make it work)
11. Identify person that will **host the webinar**. This means they will control the live stream and content


12. Identify the person that will **lead the webinar**. This means that they will be interacting with the audience, leading presentation on ASRG, introducing speaker, and giving closing remarks


13. Identify the person that will **interact with the audience**. This includes responding to questions/comments from audience, gathering questions that will be verbally presented, and **moderating Q\&A sessions**

    ****
14. Great. You have the marketing materials, event posted, and roles identified. Pat yourself on the back. You're almost there.

    &#x20;
15. Pick your technologies (next section) to make the webinar work


16. Hold a dry run with all presenters **at least** 2 days before to understand what will and won't work. This is an end-to-end dry run with a real live stream set up. Check audio. Check video. Get a sense of how it will all flow. **Agenda** for this meeting should be at least:



    * Welcome - Introductions
    * Identify Roles (Moderator / Support / Presenters / etc.)&#x20;
    * Technical Setup Checks (Audio / Video)&#x20;
    * Quick presentation reviews (Define the final webinar sequence)
    * How to work with Q\&A (Youtube Chat Window)
    * Clarify the final questions


17. Set up a calendar event for **presenters** **only** (people that will be ON the livestream) for the actual event. Ensure that all key details are in the calendar invite including the following agenda.&#x20;

    * **-15 min**:   Technical Check and Preparation
    * **0 min**:   Welcome and Short Introduction
    * **+5 min**:   Main Presentation
    * \+XX min:   Q\&A Session


18. Prepare at least an hour before the presentation. Turn off notifications. Restart your computer. Work out last minute details.


19. Hold the presentation. HAVE FUN WITH IT. Remember, you're helping build a global organization. You're doing this because you care about automotive security. Really, it's a lot of fun.

## Key Technologies

Live streaming can get pricey quick. Good thing we tested a stack that is **completely free**. It worked great! Here are the key details:

* ASRG's streaming platform is YouTube Live. For that, you will create an event. This is the admin console for the event. You will be able to "Go Live" here, see how many people are joined (and other key stats), and see real-time comments on the video.&#x20;
* You **link** to the streaming platform with a **streaming client**. You can use any you want to install on your local machine. An open source option that works well is **OBS. **[**https://obsproject.com/**](https://obsproject.com)**. **Plug your streaming key from your **streaming platform** into your **streaming client**. The streaming client allows you to control what you're screensharing, audio outputs, and more.
* Now, you need to host the webinar presenters somewhere. The key detail here is that there are multiple presenters. Paid platforms like Zoom allow you to stream a Zoom Meeting to YouTube Live, but it's very expensive. We used Google Meet. Here's how that was set up:\
  \
  Remote Presenter -> screenshare on Google Meet -> screen capture + audio output capture on OBS -> YouTube Live. \
  \
  It's key to understand this. **You need to capture the presenters screen (Google Meet) and your machine's audio output. **
* On Mac, to capture audio output as an audio input to OBS, you need to use a software middleware. I used [https://support.shinywhitebox.com/hc/en-us/articles/204161459-Installing-iShowU-Audio-Capture-Mojave-and-earlier-](https://support.shinywhitebox.com/hc/en-us/articles/204161459-Installing-iShowU-Audio-Capture-Mojave-and-earlier-). This will take any audio output from my computer, share it with my headset, and route that **output** as an **input** into OBS. This is likely easier to do on Windows.&#x20;
* For me, I needed **3 external displays** to stay organized. Here's what was on each
  * ASRG presentation.
  * OBS.
  * Google Meet.
  * YouTube Live Admin Dashboard.&#x20;
* An additional awesome thing to do before the presentation starts is leave a poll/survey up. Then, before you start the presentation, show everyone the poll results! We directed everyone to a link to anonymously answer 3 questions, and showed them all the different locations they were joining from.  We used [https://www.polleverywhere.com/](https://www.polleverywhere.com), but any choice would do.&#x20;

## Structure of ASRG-WORLD Presentation

The presentation should spend the first part talking about the ASRG. It's important that everybody in the audience gains access to key details. Here is the structure to use:

1. Title slide. (ASRG)
2. Talk title slide (who's presenting, and what are they presenting)
3. ASRG presenter pics and introduction. (Introduce yourself!)
4. What is the ASRG?
5. ASRG by chapter (show map of all chapters)
6. ASRG by numbers (show magnitude of membership)
7. ASRG in the ecosystem (show how we're partnered with others)
8. Get involved: Attend/Start/Pitch
9. Communication platforms (slack, telegram)
10. Sponsor slide.
11. Newsletter.
12. Q\&A (1-2 questions).
13. Introduce presenter
14. (remote presenter will run through presentation)
15. Final Q\&A with remote presenter.
16. Final remarks (thank everyone!)
