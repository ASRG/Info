# Hosting your First Meetup

The first few meetups have a simple goal: bring awareness that the Meetup exists. To do this, host your first event and tell everybody you can about it!&#x20;

So, what does hosting an event entail?

1. **Find a location.** Many times, companies involved with automotive security are happy to host. Make sure you choose a date/time that will work for them! We usually aim for after hours, like 7-9PM.&#x20;
2. **Find a speaker.** Reach out to local people that might have a presentation or some research they want to share. This is a great platform for them to get it out there! Keep it as casual as possible: if a presenter just wants to lead a conversation, go with it - as long as it's interesting and relevant.&#x20;
3. **Create the Meetup, and spread the link!**

Try to keep this as low effort as possible! Find a location, find a speaker, host the event. As you start your chapter, you'll start to get ahead and create a queue of presenters with reliable meeting locations.
