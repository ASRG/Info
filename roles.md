# Roles

### Roles

The idea of ASRG is not to focus on a large hierarchy.  We focus on the organization itself, and creating value for the members.  To achieve this, we use a very flat organization.  From an external view, there is only one role, the Organizer.  Internal to the organization, there might be different roles which are focused on different responsibilities or areas of development.  See below.

| **External Role**     | **Internal Role**              | Email           | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | **Responsibilities**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Organizer             | Workshop Coordinator           |                 | ASRG chapters host quarterly workshops to engage members with hands-on activities in automotive security. Workshops are typically held in one of two ways: 1) a sponsors hosts the workshop where they are showcasing their knowledge and products in a way that serves an educational purpose, or 2) a set of course content is developed within the ASRG to run the workshop. Remember, workshops can be run multiple times, so new courses DON'T need to be developed every quarter. In addition, workshops should target entry-level people to give them a means of getting real experience in the space. The Workshop Coordinator is the role that develops, plans, and leads workshops for the group!                                                                                                                                                                                          | <ul><li>Develop ASRG workshop content (slide deck, "follow-along" guide, other necessary materials)</li><li>Find a location to host the event, that includes necessities like a projector/screen, power outlets to support students, space to use hardware, etc. Most likely, this will be an ASRG sponsor's location.</li><li>Plan a "meetup event" at least a month ahead of time to allow adequate marketing of event.</li><li>Plan food for event, as workshops typically run 2-3 hours.</li></ul>                                                                                                                   |
| Organizer             | Participant Engagement Manager |                 | The ASRG is focused on creating a community that serves its members and sponsors. One important component is to help create conversations in the Slack channel to get the community talking to each other. This will offer tremendous insight into what the community is thinking alongside create exciting conversations to keep members engaged. Further, as a part of participant engagement, surveys and other tools can be used to elicit feedback from members following ASRG events.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | <ul><li>On a regular basis, create conversation in the social media and communication channels by providing news sources, opinions, or questions.

| Organizer             | Sponsorship Developer          |                 | Sponsors donations fund the work, research and events at ASRG. As a result, the ASRG will use funds to support novel, forward-thinking research to advance the automotive security space in addition to providing value to sponsors. Typically, sponsors for the ASRG are either security companies that do business in automotive, tool makers that create tools to support the space, and automotive companies that want insight into the space of automotive security. To develop sponsors with ASRG, potential sponsors need to be identified and targeted for sit-down conversations that go over the marketing information for ASRG. In addition, target sponsors are invited to come to ASRG events to see what we're all about. Finally, ASRG sponsors can come in a few forms: 1) monetary sponsorship to support ASRG efforts, 2) resource sponsorship for meeting locations and speakers. | <ul><li>Generate a list of companies to target for sponsorship and engagement.</li><li>Reach out to companies to explain mission, value add.

| Organizer             | Event Coordinator              |                 | ASRG events are run monthly, with additional quarterly events. These events need to run smoothly to make sure that members are excited to come back, and the events need to provide value to those members that decide to attend. Logistics typically involve: 1) finding a speaker to talk about their expertise in the space, 2) identifying a topic/theme for the ASRG meetup, 3) find a location to host the event (typically through a sponsor), and 4) create the Meetup event at least a month ahead of time to assure time for adequate marketing. In addition, meetups should be planned several months ahead of time, if possible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | <p>•Work with Speaker Coordinator to find a speaker for each ASRG meetup.<br>•Work with the Workshop Coordinator to handle logistics to support workshops.<br>•Find a location to host the event.<br>•Create Meetup events to allow members to plan ahead of time on attending and understand what the meetup will be about.<br>•Plan several months ahead of time.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| Organizer             | Academic Partner Developer     |                 | As a part of the ASRG's mission, private companies, nonprofits, academia, and the security/automotive communities should come together to push the future of automotive security. To get academia involved, colleges and other institutions that have a vested interested in automotive security should be contacted to understand how we can work together. Some areas to consider are: 1) collaborative research, 2) ASRG event meeting location, 3) ASRG engagement with existing courses, 4) space and tools to support security research.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | <p>•Identify institutions and individuals that will be good fits with the ASRG.<br>•Reach out to those individuals to explain the mission of ASRG to further understand possible opportunities in collaboration/partnership.<br>•Manage relationships inside of Salesforce to ensure that we're always following up and maintaining a history of contact.</p><p>•Organize/pitch possible opportunities to ASRG leaders and volunteers.</p>                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Organizer             | Federal Engagement Manager     |                 | The US Federal Government has expressed significant interest in the area of automotive security. They are actively looking for leaders to do novel research to help support efforts inside of the government, ranging from securing military vehicles/fleets to vehicle security as a part of national security. As a result, the ASRG is seeking grant money from the federal government to support projects that can bring our resources to federal initiatives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | <p>•Identify key US federal decision makers in the automotive cyber space to network with.</p><p>•Identify possible direct opportunities, such as specific grants or contracts that might be applicable to the ASRG.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
