## Templates

### Meeting Presentation

A template is available for all ASRG Meetings.  This template should be used for all meetings. Small modifications can be made to fit content and create individualization between the different locations. &#x20;

### Event Banner

To have a professional style, we have created a banner which will help to announce the meetup events.  Please update and make changes for each event and save them on your location drive.

### GDPR Document

If your meetup will be livestreamed, or recorded please ensure that the presenter(s) have signed the below form.  It doesn't matter if the region is not affected by GDPR laws and regulations, because if we will host the video content on YouTube or anywhere else, GDPR will need to be followed. &#x20;
