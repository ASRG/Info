# Overview

This document will summarize the proposal for a project at the non-profit organization Automotive Security Research Group (ASRG). The project is concentrated on the development and release of automotive security intelligence platform and generation of automotive security information.&#x20;

### GOALS&#x20;

1. Challenge the status quo and provide a quick and easy solution for threat intelligence.&#x20;
2. To be used as an input for further tool chains regarding product risk in the field.&#x20;
3. Define and develop an intelligence platform for the automotive security community.&#x20;
   1. The platform shall collect, filter for relevance, validate, and organize information from the feeds.&#x20;
   2. Present the data, and statistical analysis in a readable and understandable format. (e.g. Dashboard).&#x20;
4. Re-package the data in a feed for the automotive community to use.&#x20;
5. Process shall be automated.&#x20;
6. Platform should be using open source and cost free tools. (every person should have the ability to replicate and verify the function and process.)

### Minimum Viable Product (1st Phase)&#x20;

* Get a minimum set of feeds integrated and working (tested).&#x20;
  * Already started. Just need to update, confirm and test that the feeds are working correctly.&#x20;
  * Integrate the Upstream feed.&#x20;
* Create Relevance for information&#x20;
  * Already defined, just need to integrate, and test.&#x20;
* Enrich data with multiple Sources Partly done by threatQ, need to discuss with Falk, how this works.&#x20;
* Information to dashboard available.&#x20;
  * ThreatQ&#x20;
* Create the ASRG feed
  * TLP System (take over already existing and adapt to ASRG needs)&#x20;
  * Authentication of the users of the feed.&#x20;
  * Focus only on member feed for now.
