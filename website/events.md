## Social Media integration

We have integrated a social media post automation for some parts of the content of our website.

The relevant part for the social media automation can be found in the "Social Media automation for Events" section of the event editor. Is looks like the following:

**In order to use the automation all the shown fields need to be filled with text, otherwise the automation will not trigger**

### Preconfigured timings

Currently the social media tool is able to post to Linkedin, Facebook and Twitter.&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
**For every event that changes the state from any state to "published" the automation creates the following posts: (The obove mentioned fields are taken into consideration)**
{% endhint %}

1. Four days upfront the event (in case of a webinar on thursday 6pm -> sunday 6pm)
2. Five minutes upfront the event
3. Three days after the event (in case of a webinar on thursday 6 pm-> sunday 12am)

### Manual Settings

In case you want to go with manual settings or disable the social media automation for a event you can do that in the "WP to Buffer Pro" section inside the event editor. There you can chose to disable the automation, use the automation as preconfigured or use your own individual settings.

### Post Log

The plugin also comes with a log feature with which you can see whether posts have been scheduled or an error has occured. This can also be found in the event editior.
