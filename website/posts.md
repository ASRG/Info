# Posts

## Social Media integration

We have integrated a social media post automation for some parts of the content of our website.

The relevant part for the social media automation can be found in the "Social Media automation for Posts" section of the post editor. Is looks like the following:

**In order to use the automation all the shown fields need to be filled with text and the "Shall this article be posted on social media" dropdown set to "yes", otherwise the automation will not trigger**

### Preconfigured timings

Currently the social media tool is able to post to Linkedin, Facebook and Twitter.&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
**For every posts that changes the state from any state to "published" the automation creates a post directly. (The obove mentioned fields are taken into consideration)**
{% endhint %}

### Manual Settings

In case you want to go with manual settings or disable the social media automation for a posts you can do that in the "WP to Buffer Pro" section inside the event editor. There you can chose to disable the automation, use the automation as preconfigured or use your own individual settings.

### Post Log

The plugin also comes with a log feature with which you can see whether posts have been scheduled or an error has occured. This can also be found in the event editior.
