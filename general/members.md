# Members

## Why become a Member?

### Networking

Meet new people that are also a part of the automotive security community.  This will help initiate discussions \(non-proprietary\) regarding problems, solutions, where to find information, experiences with suppliers and so on.

### Access to Shared Information

We have a drive of presentations, specifications, books and so on, that will help you learn more about security in the automotive industry.  

### Project Support and Resources

We like to support projects and generate presentations and papers regarding automotive security research.  ASRG can support your own private projects by offering mentorship, access to project tools and resources as well as funding.

## How to become a Member?

Until now, we use Meetup Groups to manage the different ASRG locations.  The cost is **FREE**.

## What does being a Member mean?

There is no requirements or responsibilities that come with membership.  This group is for you, to enable you to do more in the automotive security world. It can mean as little as receiving our emails, or coming to local events, to presenting in the meetings, doing sponsored research or managing your own ASRG location.  This group is what you make it.

## There is no ASRG near me, can I start a new location?

Of course.  The point of ASRG is to enable people to do more and if you think a location in your area makes sense, then let's do it.  We can provide a ready made platform which can be used to start ASRG almost anywhere.  Just send us an E-Mail \(info@asrg.io\) and we can start to discuss the specifics.
