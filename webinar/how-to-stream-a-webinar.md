# How to stream a webinar

## 3 Options for streaming a webinar

### 1. The AWS setup

We have created a AWS server which shall be used for streaming a webinar. It has everything preconfigured to make it as easy as possible.

In order to use the AWS setup please follow the video guides:

The AWS Sever is not running all the time to reduce costs. In case you want to use the server please send an email to: **streaming@asrg.io** and we will start it up for you

### 2. Personal streaming setup (using your own pc)

In order to setup your own streaming setup please follow this guide:

{% hint style="danger" %}
Please select the "private Setup" scene collection inside streamlabs and **do not modify** the AWS scene collection.
{% endhint %}

### 3. Prerecorded videos

There is also an option to schedule a prerecorded video instead of streaming it live.

For this usecase we use Youtube premiere.&#x20;

In case you want to have your prerecorded video uploaded and scheduled on youtube please add our generic intro:\
\
[https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1EXVG57EufkDjJjCNU0ugPkT2lORKwsMj](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1EXVG57EufkDjJjCNU0ugPkT2lORKwsMj) \
\
upfront the talk and then upload the video to:\
[\
https://asrgroup-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/julian\_brucker\_asrg\_io/EmwswmPhGLVMiGb9jRLwWaUBCLBFvoYiDptHehgXEiEW1w?e=O0kexa](https://asrgroup-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/julian\_brucker\_asrg\_io/EmwswmPhGLVMiGb9jRLwWaUBCLBFvoYiDptHehgXEiEW1w?e=O0kexa)

As a last step please send an email to: **streaming@asrg.io** containing a link to your uploaded video to request a youtube schedule. In case you dont have the right tooling to add the ASRG Intro yourself please also mention that in the mail and we will add it for you.
