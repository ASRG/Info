# Monthly Meetings

The oldest form \(and most secure?\) of communication is the conversation, the face to face, person to person discussion.  I know it's old school, but getting to know the people that are interested or developing the automotive security market is very important.  It's these people, that you can rely on to ask questions, build relationships and get feedback.
